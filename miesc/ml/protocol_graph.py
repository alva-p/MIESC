"""
Protocol Graph — cross-file/cross-contract reasoning (MEJORAS.md item #5).

Merges per-file call graphs (miesc.ml.call_graph.CallGraphBuilder, now
contract-segmented) across a set of Solidity files into one picture of the
protocol: which contracts inherit from which, which contracts call which
others, and a heuristic storage-collision risk flag for upgradeable bases
missing a `__gap`. Regex-based, same rigor level as the rest of the
codebase's Solidity parsing (see call_graph.py's own docstring) — not a
real compiler/parser, and explicitly not byte-accurate storage-slot
arithmetic (see MEJORAS.md #5 for why that's out of scope).
