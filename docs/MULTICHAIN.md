# Multi-Chain Support

MIESC provides production security analysis for **EVM chains**. Support for other platforms
is on the **roadmap**: experimental adapter code exists but is not production-validated.

All non-EVM usage below goes through the `miesc analyze` command, not `miesc scan` — `scan`
has no `--chain` option. Of the 7 non-EVM adapter files that exist in the codebase, only 3
are actually reachable from the CLI:

## Support Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ✅ **Production** | Full 9-layer analysis with 50 tools across 35 analysis modules. Recommended for audits. |
| 🛣️ **Wired (Roadmap)** | Solana, Move, Starknet/Cairo — reachable via `miesc analyze`, pattern-based, NOT production-validated — not for security decisions yet. |
| 💀 **Not wired** | NEAR, Stellar/Soroban, Algorand, Cardano — adapter code exists in `miesc/adapters/` but has zero production call site; `miesc analyze` does not accept these as `--chain` values today (only `ethereum\|move\|starknet\|solana`) and no other command routes to them. Only reachable by importing the adapter class directly in Python. |

## EVM Chains (Production)

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready

Supported networks: Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, and all EVM-compatible chains.

## NEAR Protocol (Not wired)

**Status:** 💀 Not wired — `near_adapter.py` exists but no CLI command routes to it.
`miesc analyze --chain near` does not exist (`analyze` only accepts
`ethereum|move|starknet|solana`). Only reachable today by importing `NearAnalyzer` directly
in Python; the vulnerability classes below are what the adapter's pattern matchers implement,
not what you get by running a `miesc` command.

### Languages
- Rust with near-sdk

### Detected Vulnerabilities
- Reentrancy via callbacks
- Improper access control
- Panic in callbacks
- Storage key collision
- Serde vulnerabilities
- Missing predecessor check
- Unchecked promise results

### Usage
Not invocable via CLI today. Direct Python only:
```python
from miesc.adapters.near_adapter import NearAnalyzer
findings = NearAnalyzer().detect_vulnerabilities(NearAnalyzer().parse(Path("contract.rs")))
```

---

## Move (Sui/Aptos) (Wired, Roadmap)

**Status:** 🛣️ Wired via `miesc analyze` - Experimental (pattern detection only). Note: the
CLI has a single `move` chain, not separate `sui`/`aptos` values.

### Languages
- Move language

### Detected Vulnerabilities
- Object ownership issues (Sui)
- Capability leaks
- Flash loan vulnerabilities
- Unchecked arithmetic
- Reentrancy patterns
- Missing access control
- Timestamp dependencies

### Usage
```bash
miesc analyze module.move            # auto-detected from .move
miesc analyze module.move --chain move
```

## Stellar/Soroban (Not wired)

**Status:** 💀 Not wired — `stellar_adapter.py` exists but no CLI command routes to it.
`miesc analyze --chain stellar` does not exist. Only reachable by importing
`StellarAnalyzer` directly in Python.

### Languages
- Rust with Soroban SDK

### Detected Vulnerabilities
- Missing authorization checks
- Panic/unwrap in contracts
- Cross-contract call risks
- TTL (Time-To-Live) issues

Not invocable via CLI today. Direct Python only:
```python
from miesc.adapters.stellar_adapter import StellarAnalyzer
findings = StellarAnalyzer().detect_vulnerabilities(StellarAnalyzer().parse(Path("contract.rs")))
```

## Algorand (Not wired)

**Status:** 💀 Not wired — `algorand_adapter.py` exists but no CLI command routes to it.

## Recommendations

### For Production Audits
Use **EVM analysis** for a full security assessment:
- Full 9-layer defense coverage
- 50 integrated tools / 35 analysis modules
- Backed detection numbers (SmartBugs full corpus: 95.8% recall; see the README benchmarks)
- Professional report generation

### For Research/Exploration
The 3 CLI-wired non-EVM analyzers (Solana, Move, Starknet/Cairo, via `miesc analyze`) are
useful for:
- Initial vulnerability scanning
- Pattern identification
- Security research
- Pre-audit exploration

The other 4 (NEAR, Stellar, Algorand, Cardano) require importing the adapter class directly
in Python — there is no `miesc` command that reaches them today.

**Do not rely on roadmap (non-EVM) analyzers for production security decisions.**

## Roadmap

| Phase | Chains | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Current (v6.0.0) | EVM | Production (9 layers, 50 tools) |
| Current (v6.0.0) | Solana, Move, Starknet/Cairo | Wired via `miesc analyze`, experimental |
| Not started | NEAR, Stellar, Algorand, Cardano | Adapter code exists, no CLI wiring yet |
| Future | All chains | Production-grade multi-chain |
